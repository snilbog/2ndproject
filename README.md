# 2ndproject

For my second project I set up a backend- server, database and middleware to connect the frontend via a session route. I used various NPM modules for installation, such as express, pg, Yelp, bcrypt, sequelize and a geomapper. 
For my API I chose Yelp. In the end it did not have all the functions I needed but the basics of what I wanted out of my page were completed.
For styling I used bootstrap (mainly a navbar) and css for images and color. 
Different coding languages I used were; javascript, node, css, jQuery and express.
I did not find a way to add the pricing of restaurants as the api did not have a model for it. I did not emply a delete from favorites button yet, and a line appeared on my login page that I did not set...cannot find that bugger anywhere yet.

Narrowing down an app was one of the hard parts. I used a google api at first and then ended up using the Yelp api. Setting up the backend was my first steps. Initilitizing express, postgres, sequelize, bcrypt, yelp, geomapper started my app. Then I defined the database. (later deleted and added a different one as my app came together) Then I created the layout of the home page. Added a search bar and was able to run the api. Then I ran all my routes and added and encrypted login and authentication page. Finally I added a favorites pages only accessable after you've logged in. Then I deployed my app with Heroku to the www.
